			<p>Although most dogs are loyal, especially if you take good care of them, some can still be independent and aloof. This is what makes the Golden Retriever special. Unlike other breeds that would rather be dominant, they enjoy being commanded by their owners. Best of all, they pay importance to family time, making them the perfect companion and pet for those with children or already starting a family.</p>
